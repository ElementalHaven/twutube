In this run you kill all 4 bosses of each episode, in their respective episodes while skipping the majority of the levels. The routing involves making sure we play through the fastest levels in the game and then proceeding to kill each of the bosses.","gameName":"Blood","game":"blood","length":250,"chat":[],"images":[]}
