{"created":"2016-06-10T16:36:44.000Z","title":"Daikatana Playthrough -- Part 3","description":"Finished! So, yes, John Romero made me his bitch. I actually enjoyed this game. There were some shitty parts of course, I got lost a bunch but that&#39;s normal to all old FPS&#39;s. The Daikatana itself was pretty stupid, the story was fucking awful and the fact that they tried to make the story important is embarrassing, the end boss was the worst I&#39;ve ever seen. But the game was fun overall for me and I think it&#39;s a game worth playing with the most recent patch. I&#39;m very interested in the speedrun also, because this game has very fast movement and tons of opportunities for boosting.","gameName":"Daikatana","game":"daikatana","length":18633,"chat":[{"user":"TheKinsie","color":null,"offset":11487,"fragments":[{"text":"man, hexen 3 looks weird"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"BEARDYDYD","color":"#FF69B4","offset":11501,"fragments":[{"text":"boobonic plague"}],"badges":[0]},{"user":"BEARDYDYD","color":"#FF69B4","offset":11506,"fragments":[{"text":"GiantBalloons"}],"badges":[0]},{"user":"Crowndeagle","color":"#B22222","offset":11553,"fragments":[{"text":"good lord that face"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"BabyBaner","color":"#8A2BE2","offset":11570,"fragments":[{"text":"folded over 500 times "},{"text":"Kappa","emote":1}],"badges":[0]},{"user":"TheWolfArokh","color":"#B22222","offset":11596,"fragments":[{"text":"Those arms D:"}],"badges":[2]},{"user":"TheKinsie","color":null,"offset":11602,"fragments":[{"text":"festering taint "},{"text":"WutFace","emote":3}],"badges":[]},{"user":"TheKinsie","color":null,"offset":11687,"fragments":[{"text":"such power can never truly be boken"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Skuttie","color":"#8A2BE2","offset":11708,"fragments":[{"text":"It may be a magic sword but it's no inconceivable steak"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"TheKinsie","color":null,"offset":11710,"fragments":[{"text":"the sword is charged with a powerful bokeh filter"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Clamsss","color":"#FF7F50","offset":11712,"fragments":[{"text":"these fucking camera angles"}],"badges":[4]},{"user":"AnnoySumo","color":null,"offset":11718,"fragments":[{"text":"these cutscenes are longer than in mgs4"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"TheKinsie","color":null,"offset":11741,"fragments":[{"text":"i wish the pitch shift filter on this monks voice was less obvious"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Skuttie","color":"#8A2BE2","offset":11755,"fragments":[{"text":"let me just take a big ole exposition dump before letting you go off into the wilderness there"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"BEARDYDYD","color":"#FF69B4","offset":11776,"fragments":[{"text":"so a call of cthulhu trailer for e3 was just uploaded https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHbuE7rbDzs"}],"badges":[0]},{"user":"mspycode","color":"#0000FF","offset":11787,"fragments":[{"text":"coobFreeman","emote":5},{"text":" "},{"text":"coobCrab","emote":6},{"text":" "},{"text":"ChefFrank","emote":7}],"badges":[4,8,9]},{"user":"TheKinsie","color":null,"offset":11794,"fragments":[{"text":"design is law, but apparently \"show, don't tell\" is not.\\"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Skuttie","color":"#8A2BE2","offset":11800,"fragments":[{"text":"Another preschool puzzle "},{"text":"PogChamp","emote":10}],"badges":[]},{"user":"DraQu_","color":"#8317B5","offset":11834,"fragments":[{"text":"thank god I got proper internet just in time for daikatana "},{"text":"ResidentSleeper","emote":11}],"badges":[4]},{"user":"TheKinsie","color":null,"offset":11894,"fragments":[{"text":"were you... counter-strike surfing on that rooftop"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"DraQu_","color":"#8317B5","offset":11951,"fragments":[{"text":"why are you playing thief and why do you have a mechanic freddy glove"}],"badges":[4]},{"user":"Clamsss","color":"#FF7F50","offset":12008,"fragments":[{"text":"hey why dont you use the flak cannon if youre playing unreal"}],"badges":[4]},{"user":"DraQu_","color":"#8317B5","offset":12083,"fragments":[{"text":"You don't.
