It&#39;s always exciting to find out about these old games that slipped under the radar. So far it&#39;s very cool and unique, and I&#39;m enjoying it quite a bit. I think each character has a unique starting level, so I might do those after finishing the first playthrough.","gameName":"Eradicator","game":"eradicator","length":6168,"chat":[{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":193,"fragments":[{"text":"What's poppin brother"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":266,"fragments":[{"text":"I'm building my own house in Doom rn"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":328,"fragments":[{"text":"The first key is in the toilet"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":377,"fragments":[{"text":"I realized that imagining my own areas was like impossible for me"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":385,"fragments":[{"text":"So now I'm just making my house"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":467,"fragments":[{"text":"Also I can't find any way of having one room above another so I'm gonna have to have a teleporter get upstairs"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":515,"fragments":[{"text":"sucks tbh"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":566,"fragments":[{"text":"Quake is for normies imo"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":688,"fragments":[{"text":"btw why are you subscribed to an 11 year old girl leafyishere clone on yt"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":734,"fragments":[{"text":"LOL"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":747,"fragments":[{"text":"not bad"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":819,"fragments":[{"text":"You aren't even subbed to Customgrow420 what is this"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":829,"fragments":[{"text":"AND you live in colorado what the hecky"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":879,"fragments":[{"text":"#VapeNation"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":914,"fragments":[{"text":"I live in England and I hate the English"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":926,"fragments":[{"text":"Like if all English people would just die that would be great"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":928,"fragments":[{"text":"myself included"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":955,"fragments":[{"text":"Yeah the h3h3 leafy war is pretty dumb"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"pacman_pol_pl_polska","color":"#FFFFFF","offset":959,"fragments":[{"text":"That's a great opportunity to get into islam and blow yourself up "},{"text":"MingLee","emote":0}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":981,"fragments":[{"text":"I'd rather not tbh"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"pacman_pol_pl_polska","color":"#FFFFFF","offset":992,"fragments":[{"text":"Smart "},{"text":"FUNgineer","emote":1}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":1023,"fragments":[{"text":"ISIS is not very Nice-is tbh"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":1048,"fragments":[{"text":"I'm gonna go and live in Burmistan"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":1059,"fragments":[{"text":"It's the deadliest country in the world because of their wildlife"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":1065,"fragments":[{"text":"Literally like Australia but 10x worse"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Jezs_","color":"#5F9EA0","offset":1117,"fragments":[{"text":"The Burmanese Red-Back Screaming Orangutan has more confirmed kills than nadeshot"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"trolcatz","color":"#FF0000","offset":1627,"fragments":[{"text":"cirHi","emote":2}],"badges":[]},{"user":"CyrusVorazan","color":"#1E90FF","offset":2206,"fragments":[{"text":"Hey peepl, how's descent going?
