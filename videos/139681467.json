Had some things that were better than Quake 4 and Doom 3, and I really liked the portals and weird mario galaxy style stuff that would happen occasionally. Purely fun game; only issue I have is that it might be too easy with the ability to just respawn right into combat if you die.","ytid":"dbAYx8e2Zmo","gameName":"Prey","game":"prey","length":20056,"chat":[{"user":"Softman25","color":"#B22222","offset":64,"fragments":[{"text":"Dope ass shit "},{"text":"Kreygasm","emote":0}],"badges":[1]},{"user":"Sonadors","color":"#0000FF","offset":68,"fragments":[{"text":"Oh neat."}],"badges":[2]},{"user":"Softman25","color":"#B22222","offset":118,"fragments":[{"text":"Reminder to GAMBLE"}],"badges":[1]},{"user":"Sonadors","color":"#0000FF","offset":148,"fragments":[{"text":"Oh this game"}],"badges":[2]},{"user":"Sonadors","color":"#0000FF","offset":152,"fragments":[{"text":"with interactable everything"}],"badges":[2]},{"user":"Sonadors","color":"#0000FF","offset":175,"fragments":[{"text":"Duke Nukem Forever: Before"}],"badges":[2]},{"user":"Tryedz","color":"#9661FF","offset":228,"fragments":[{"text":"coobThinking","emote":3},{"text":" /"}],"badges":[1,4]},{"user":"Luc1dd","color":"#8A2BE2","offset":241,"fragments":[{"text":"yaaaaaaaaaay prey!"}],"badges":[5]},{"user":"Luc1dd","color":"#8A2BE2","offset":243,"fragments":[{"text":":D","emote":6}],"badges":[5]},{"user":"Softman25","color":"#B22222","offset":250,"fragments":[{"text":"What a disrespecting little prick "},{"text":"DansGame","emote":7}],"badges":[1]},{"user":"loveless_tv","color":"#470085","offset":298,"fragments":[{"text":"sup Cube and peeps "},{"text":"KonCha","emote":8}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Tryedz","color":"#9661FF","offset":311,"fragments":[{"text":"lmfao"}],"badges":[1,4]},{"user":"Sonadors","color":"#0000FF","offset":320,"fragments":[{"text":"Oh shit Heart"}],"badges":[2]},{"user":"Sonadors","color":"#0000FF","offset":322,"fragments":[{"text":"I love Heart"}],"badges":[2]},{"user":"Softman25","color":"#B22222","offset":333,"fragments":[{"text":"Stop hitting on 16 "},{"text":"DansGame","emote":7}],"badges":[1]},{"user":"loveless_tv","color":"#470085","offset":333,"fragments":[{"text":"played this last summer for the first time since release, i was surprised at how well it aged"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Sonadors","color":"#0000FF","offset":334,"fragments":[{"text":"also in before VoD Mute"}],"badges":[2]},{"user":"loveless_tv","color":"#470085","offset":377,"fragments":[{"text":"new tunes "},{"text":"DansGame","emote":7}],"badges":[]},{"user":"LordZergeant","color":"#B22222","offset":380,"fragments":[{"text":"!tap"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"botface21","color":null,"offset":380,"fragments":[{"text":"LordZergeant taps Sonadors's ass"}],"badges":[1]},{"user":"Luc1dd","color":"#8A2BE2","offset":399,"fragments":[{"text":"I'm about half way through it now too"}],"badges":[5]},{"user":"VashGuy","color":"#069420","offset":438,"fragments":[{"text":"boyksHi","emote":9}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Tryedz","color":"#9661FF","offset":474,"fragments":[{"text":"most intense start ever"}],"badges":[1,4]},{"user":"Tryedz","color":"#9661FF","offset":475,"fragments":[{"text":"!tap"}],"badges":[1,4]},{"user":"botface21","color":null,"offset":475,"fragments":[{"text":"Tryedz taps Luc1dd's ass"}],"badges":[1]},{"user":"HighLikeNASA","color":null,"offset":557,"fragments":[{"text":"this isnt the new prey?"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Tryedz","color":"#9661FF","offset":582,"fragments":[{"text":"WannaDance"}],"badges":[1,4]},{"user":"loveless_tv","color":"#470085","offset":590,"fragments":[{"text":"beat down incoming"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"VashGuy","color":"#069420","offset":641,"fragments":[{"text":"we only beat their heads in with a wrench, im sure theyre fine"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Softman25","color":"#B22222","offset":691,"fragments":[{"text":"It's a plot device portal -
