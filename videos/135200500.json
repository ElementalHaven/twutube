{"created":"2017-04-12T21:33:12.000Z","title":"Duke Nukem Forever playthrough -- Part 1","description":"Finally playing the infamous Duke Nukem Forever for the first time. So far it&#39;s kind of what I expected. Extremely linear and simple like a CoD campaign with some silly shit mixed in. Duke spouts old memes constantly but I like the interaction with the world, even if it&#39;s a bit overboard. The guns are pretty fun, but I can&#39;t help but feel like the fights are kind of boring.","gameName":"Duke Nukem Forever","game":"duke-nukem-forever","length":10892,"chat":[{"user":"AfroDynomite","color":"#0000FF","offset":140,"fragments":[{"text":"ahoy"}],"badges":[0]},{"user":"Tryedz","color":"#9661FF","offset":264,"fragments":[{"text":"!tap"}],"badges":[1,2]},{"user":"botface21","color":null,"offset":264,"fragments":[{"text":"Tryedz taps AfroDynomite's ass"}],"badges":[1]},{"user":"AfroDynomite","color":"#0000FF","offset":275,"fragments":[{"text":"!tap"}],"badges":[0]},{"user":"botface21","color":null,"offset":275,"fragments":[{"text":"AfroDynomite rips AfroDynomite's dick off!
