{"created":"2017-04-03T21:33:14.000Z","title":"Duke Nukem Zero Hour playthrough -- Part 2","description":"Since I lost my save file I had to playthrough the beginning again. I changed the settings to high resolution textures, which ended up lowering the framerate quite a bit. This game was really fun and cool, and I&#39;m glad to have finally played it! Thanks Pogokeen! I&#39;m thinking of playing it again on Hard, finding all the time machine parts, in first person and with low res textures to raise FPS as much as possible.","gameName":"Duke Nukem: Zero
