{"created":"2017-04-18T21:43:26.000Z","title":"Perfect Dark (Emulator with Keyboard and Mouse) playthrough -- Part 1","description":"Apologies for the constant muting of my mic and sniffling and the crashing at the end. Other than all that shit, I&#39;m enjoying this game a lot. I&#39;m using 1964 with a mouse injector made specifically for Perfect Dark and Goldeneye. It&#39;s very easy to find and setup, and it works quite well. It makes the game easier though, since the framerate is mostly stable and mouse aim is easier than using a control stick; that&#39;s why I decided to play on Perfect Agent difficulty. Also the fact that you get more objectives is cool, I think. This makes me want to play Goldeneye, so I might just do that after I finish this game.","gameName":"PERFECT
