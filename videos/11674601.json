There&#39;s a segmented run of the game which is how I learned it, and it completes the game in 1:36:09. He doesn&#39;t use save hovering, I don&#39;t think he knew about it. He also didn&#39;t use dodging, which makes you move quite a bit faster. So I think I&#39;ll be able to beat the segmented time if I do all those things. Pretty fun run!","gameName":"Unknown","game":"unknown","length":6221,"chat":[],"images":[]}
