Going back and forth between levels with new powerups to get stuff. Really cool. The game was a lot easier than the DOS version though, and I liked the fact that there were usable items in that game. But the weapons in this game were a lot better. Both versions have their merits, but this one is probably a bit better (especially considering you don&#39;t have to play in dosbox with pretty bad controls)","gameName":"PowerSlave","game":"powerslave","length":13770,"chat":[{"user":"Pavichokche","color":"#0000FF","offset":4621,"fragments":[{"text":"haha alright, pogokeen, just text me"}],"badges":[0,1,2]},{"user":"AlteredCourse","color":"#FF0000","offset":4622,"fragments":[{"text":"CPM *"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"koranex","color":null,"offset":4630,"fragments":[{"text":"Cubeface have you played Quake Champions?"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"koranex","color":null,"offset":4641,"fragments":[{"text":"PuppetMaster69 ok you got me, lol"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"pogokeen","color":"#008000","offset":4641,"fragments":[{"text":"Will do!
