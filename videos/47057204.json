One of them eventually got tired of the constant headache that he would get everyday from getting stomped on by a crazy, bunnyhopping, maniac. &#34; I&#39;m sick of getting jumped on by this asshole!&#34; He decided that he had enough! It was time to show the crazy bhopper that he isn&#39;t the boss. He sharpened his claws and clenched his headcrab butt, and in one quick move, he crushed the man and exploded his entire body somehow.","gameName":"Half-Life","game":"half-life","length":40,"chat":[],"images":[]}
