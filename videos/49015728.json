My run isn&#39;t single segment so they&#39;re not really comparable like that but still the fact that it&#39;s that close is pretty insane. There are 2 levels in Episode 4 that didn&#39;t count secrets, that&#39;s just because I didn&#39;t hit the trigger but I was still in the area. Some of the triggers for secrets are a bit strange. The 8/9 on E4M7 is because I went in the first teleporter a bit too far to the right. So yeah it&#39;s a bit glitchy.","gameName":"Quake","game":"quake","length":4355,"chat":[],"images":[],"ytid":"8_9-9wgrlmc"}
