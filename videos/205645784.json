Also out of the four endings I got the worst one, and it seems like getting a better one probably wouldn&#39;t even be that hard, so I fucked up pretty bad. But, it&#39;s my first playthrough and I didn&#39;t get spoiled on how to get the good endings. I wasted a lot of items without knowing how important they&#39;d be later on. Anyway, the game was fun and it&#39;s probably the most disturbing and bizarre game I&#39;ve ever played.","gameName":"Silent Hill 4: The
