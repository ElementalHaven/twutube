They both use DOSBox.\nIn order to get the game running well you&#39;re going to need to do some changes in dosboxBlood.conf\nTo get rid of cutscenes (which is recommended as they usually will mess up the resolution) go into BLOOD.INI and simply\ndelete the text after CutSceneA= and CutWavA= and so on with CutSceneB, etc.\nBy default the game plays OGG music tracks, this will show you how to play MIDI tracks instead of the OGG tracks.\nFirst scroll down to the bottom of dosboxBlood.conf and find the autoexec lines.\nChange: imgmount D game.inst -t iso\nTo: imgmount D game.gog -t iso\nAnd enjoy your MIDI music!\nBMouse is allowed in speedruns and you can find out how to use it in the link above.","gameName":"Unknown","game":"unknown","length":4357,"chat":[],"images":[],"ytid":"ymEi2i-LJiA"}
