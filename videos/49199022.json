The world record for this category was 8:27 In-game by PerOxyd, so this run is faster than that, but stx-Vile did a run on Nightmare that was 8:01 In-game. So the fact that the Nightmare record is faster than Ultra-Violence (basically) is pretty damn silly. But that&#39;s stx-Vile for ya.","gameName":"Heretic","game":"heretic","length":564,"chat":[],"images":[]}
