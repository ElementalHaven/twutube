I am having a lot of fun with this game so far. I run on ZDoom because that version allows you to rocket jump and the one run I found on youtube does that. Once I beat that time I may start using veteran edition and go for the best ending.","gameName":"Unknown","game":"unknown","length":1283,"chat":[],"images":[]}
