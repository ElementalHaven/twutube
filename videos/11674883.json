Pretty sweet RNG except for the very end where ignite just couldn&#39;t kill that golem. Still quite fast though. This technically beats the WR time for 8:31, but he played the game at a much slower cycle rate for whatever reason. But hey, this is RTA sooooo yeah, I dunno.","gameName":"Unknown","game":"unknown","length":500,"chat":[],"images":[]}
