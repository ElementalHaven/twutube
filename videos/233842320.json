I remember thinking it was funny and I liked the fact that it had skittles in it. Well, now I&#39;m playing it again, and holy shit is it an unbelievably stupid/bizarre game. I mean, it&#39;s not shitty to play, it&#39;s fairly enjoyable, but the story and the dialogue in the game is just so cringey it&#39;s insane. This game is definitely going to be an experience.
