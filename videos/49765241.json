Changes the difficulty from Impossible to Easy after the invincibility glitch. This allows for more Psi and less cost for skills. This route utilizes the skill relocation far more, since Easy allows us to obtain it before Duplication. Usually we&#39;d get it right before the tram, but in this route we get it right after researching Toxin A. Also, the difficulty switch allows us to duplicate far more Speed Hypos, doubling our amount half way through the game.","gameName":"System Shock 2","game":"system-shock-2","length":1515,"chat":[],"images":[]}
