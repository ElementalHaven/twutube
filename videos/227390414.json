But yeah this game is better than the first one so far. It&#39;s harder and more balanced, but the levels are a bit fucked up. Not really well designed, but the first game had that issue too.","gameName":"Witchaven II: Blood Vengeance","game":"witchaven-ii-blood-vengeance","length":6440,"chat":[],"images":[],"ytid":"hWrZBHuvL3U"}
