The Silent Hill lore is neat, because it&#39;s a big thing that makes almost no sense and you have to try and make some sense of it. I think this game got a lot better in the second half. I enjoyed the fact that the story was more of a personal story for James, whereas Silent Hill 1 was more about the town and the cult.","gameName":"Silent Hill 2","game":"silent-hill-2","length":18540,"chat":[{"user":"Kicho1","color":"#0000FF","offset":157,"fragments":[{"text":"Sup cube, I think Maria slept long enough.
