{"created":"2017-06-14T22:00:03.000Z","title":"Blood 2 The Chosen playthrough -- Part 1","description":"This game has been pretty annoying to get working. Decided to just play it in full screen 1920x1080 using some patches because it actually works decently well that way. I feel pretty mixed on the game right now. There&#39;s some shit I don&#39;t like about the Lithtech engine, and the hit scan enemies and the few amount of health drops you get are annoying as hell. But besides that it&#39;s not unbelievably bad, I&#39;m having some sort of fun with it.","gameName":"Blood II: The
