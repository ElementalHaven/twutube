Definitely enjoyed this marine campaign as much as AVP1, possibly a bit more considering it actually had some aspect of story and continuation. Excited to play the Predator and Alien campaigns, and then the expansion after.","gameName":"Aliens versus Predator 2","game":"aliens-versus-predator-2","length":12122,"chat":[],"images":[]}
