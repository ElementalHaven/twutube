Really fucked up Ion Storm and John Romero. I&#39;m playing with patch 1.3 which came out on March, 2016. So it&#39;s a very recent patch and the game runs very well now. I think it&#39;s not too bad of a game tbh, it&#39;s pretty fun. Will keep playing it.","gameName":"Daikatana","game":"daikatana","length":18203,"chat":[],"images":[]}
