{"created":"2017-12-07T22:57:02.000Z","title":"Silent Hill: Homecoming playthrough — Part 1","description":"This game is nothing like previous Silent Hills. They decided to focus on combat mostly, and they took stuff from the 2006 movie, which is just not the best idea. The game has some moments that are creepy, and it&#39;s not like the combat is horrible, it&#39;s actually kind of decent. The graphics aren&#39;t bad either, except for character faces (other than the main character). Overall this game is mediocre. The PC port is fucking horrible too, which really makes it annoying.","gameName":"Silent Hill: Origins","game":"silent-hill-origins","length":17450,"chat":[{"user":"pogokeen","color":"#008000","offset":774,"fragments":[{"text":"AHHHH that makes sense!"}],"badges":[0]},{"user":"pogokeen","color":"#008000","offset":809,"fragments":[{"text":"That would totally cause that issue, that's really interesting"}],"badges":[0]},{"user":"pogokeen","color":"#008000","offset":1150,"fragments":[{"text":"That was a really unsettling stairwell"}],"badges":[0]},{"user":"Sharp_Crocodile811","color":null,"offset":1156,"fragments":[{"text":"wtf"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Pavichokche","color":"#0000FF","offset":1169,"fragments":[{"text":"omg these games....."}],"badges":[0,1,2]},{"user":"Sharp_Crocodile811","color":null,"offset":1177,"fragments":[{"text":"Wait what, stop"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"Sharp_Crocodile811","color":null,"offset":1188,"fragments":[{"text":"??????????"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"pogokeen","color":"#008000","offset":1211,"fragments":[{"text":"\"Your mother and I are going.... to the test... chamber\""}],"badges":[0]},{"user":"pogokeen","color":"#008000","offset":1268,"fragments":[{"text":"^ "},{"text":"BloodTrail","emote":3}],"badges":[0]},{"user":"Sharp_Crocodile811","color":null,"offset":1299,"fragments":[{"text":"Toxic af"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"pogokeen","color":"#008000","offset":1314,"fragments":[{"text":"\"The test chamberrrrrrrrrrr\" ~Gordon Freeman scrawls on the piece of paper in his final moments"}],"badges":[0]},{"user":"LordZergeant","color":"#B22222","offset":1425,"fragments":[{"text":"more Hilent Sill nice hey Coob + chat"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"LordZergeant","color":"#B22222","offset":1429,"fragments":[{"text":"!melee Cubeface21"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"botface21","color":null,"offset":1430,"fragments":[{"text":"LordZergeant swings at Cubeface21 with a baseball bat, and misses!"}],"badges":[0,4,5]},{"user":"AlienPathogen","color":"#2E8B57","offset":1623,"fragments":[{"text":"hi all TechGod"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"AlienPathogen","color":"#2E8B57","offset":1629,"fragments":[{"text":"!tap"}],"badges":[]},{"user":"botface21","color":null,"offset":1629,"fragments":[{"text":"1path0gen1 rips 1path0gen1's dick off!
